Why do we need Xpath and CSS selector?
Developers may not provide all the locators in html
By using Xpath and CSS we can identify elements with any
given attributes

What is an Xpath?
Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath?
2 Types:
Absolute Xpath --> It starts from the starting note of the HTML
                   It always starts with a single slash (/)
                   e.g /html/body/div/div/div
Relative Xpath --> It will start from any node in html
                   It always starts with double slash(//)

Syntax For Relative Xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']
e.g //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']
e.g //a[text() = 'Create new account']
//h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
e.g. //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

starts-with will identify elements with its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
e.g. //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent-child-sibling relationships

identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g.//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying element by preceding sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g. //span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying element by its parents
//tagname
