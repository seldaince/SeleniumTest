Selenium Class 2

We will interact inside of the page in this class

What is a WebElement?
-- anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
   e.g buttons, textboxes (where you type), checkboxes, links
-- each and every element has an uniqueness and attribute behind the page
-- when ever we want to interact with the page we need to right click and click inspect on the page
   to interact with the elements behind the screens
-- we will see a lot of codes and this is HTML

HTML?
-- HyperText Markup Language (will help us to work with each element when using selenium)
-- when ever we inspect this window (with HTML language) will popup and it's called DOM

What is DOM?
-- DOM Stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
-- Also called as Developer's tools or dev tools

Why is it called DOM?
Document --> a simple html document which represents the page we are inspecting
Object --> any new line in HTML is considered to be an Object
Model --> how the page is structured (blueprint) - it is just a layout of the HTML

How to tell new line in HTML?
-- It is expandable you will see HTML and then head and body.
-- When moving your mouse on the body on the DOM page is getting selected
-- The body is the top of the structure and has a huge object in there because it has an
   <opening and closing>
-- There are more objects inside the body object that is why it's huge

When ever you want to interact with a specific element, on the top left corner there is a
cuercial (square box) that will highlight the specific element when you move you mouse and it
will automatically show the line on the DOM. If it is a login button you need to click on it

Locator
-- is an address or a position of a webelement on the webpage
-- is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage we want to interact with

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CssSelectors
- ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g linktext and partialLinktext are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor which indicates it is a link

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates

-- Anything we see with a value on the DOM it is an attribute/locator in selenium
-- Anything we see with purple is the tag name

methods used:
-- findElement() use one of the locators after findElement() such as -> By.id() , By.name() ,ect
